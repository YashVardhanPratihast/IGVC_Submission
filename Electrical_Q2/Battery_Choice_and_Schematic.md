To get somethings clear:

The battery pack should provide a potential difference of 48V Also-

Without Added Weight:
  
  Average Power consumption taking into account efficiency would be
    =(48 * 30+150)/0.82= 1939 Watts
    
  Therefore for 2hrs the average energy needed will be 3878 Wh
    
   =>Avg Current drawn from the battery would be 1939/48=40.4 Amps
   
  Peak power consumption would be
  
  =(48 * 47+150)/0.82=2406 W
  
  Therefore for 2hrs the peak energy needed will be 4812 Wh
  
  =>Peak current drawn would be=50.125 Amps

With added weight the motor would draw 15% more current therefore:
  
  Avg power consumption
    
  =(48 * 30 * 1.15+150)/0.82= 2202 Watts
  
  =>Avg current drawn= 2202/48=46A
  
  Peak power consumption
    
  =(48 * 47 * 1.15+150)/0.82= 3347 Watts
  
  Therefore for 2hrs the peak energy needed will be 6694 Wh
  
  =>Peak current drawn would be= 70 Amps

Using the given discharge rates we calculate the avg. current discharge as battery capacity*discharge rate

A:37.2

B:42.8

C:40.9

D:40.3

E:43.55


Considering upper limit of 6694 Wh

We will choose a 2 series 2 parallel combination

each of the batteries 2series will give energies of:

A:48*62=2976

B:48*63=3024

C:48*61=2928

D:48*65=3120

E:48*67=3216

We will use 2 E type batteries in series and 2 of such connections in parallel to get a total energy of 3216*2=6432 Wh which is the closest to 6694.

Also corresponding to this peak current drawable is 114 A and avg current drawable is 43.55*2=87A



The connection will look something like this
