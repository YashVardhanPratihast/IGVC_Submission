There are mainly two types of suspension systems,viz. :
Independent Systems->each wheel is connected to the carâ€™s chassis independently, allowing it to move without affecting the opposite wheel.(expensive)
Dependent Systems->the movement of one wheel is directly linked to the movement of the opposite wheel.(cheaper)

I have chosen to brief about solid axle suspension which is cheaper as well useful for rear wheels ( typical of a 3 wheeled bot like that by abhiyaan iit madras )-->

A type of dependent suspension where both wheels on the axle are connected and move together. The axle itself is a single, rigid beam that spans the distance between the two wheels on opposite sides of the vehicle.

Key components of a solid axle suspension include:

    Axle Housing: This is the main structural component that houses the differential and the axle shafts. The axle housing supports the entire weight of the vehicle and connects the left and right wheels.
    Differential: The differential allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds, which is especially useful during turns.
    Leaf Springs or Coil Springs: These springs provide suspension and help absorb shocks from the road. Leaf springs are more commonly used in solid axle setups for trucks(therefore not necessary here), while coil springs can also be found in some solid axle configurations.
    Shock Absorbers: Attached to the axle or frame, shock absorbers dampen the oscillations caused by bumps and road irregularities.
    U-bolts and Mounting Hardware: U-bolts are often used to secure the axle housing to the leaf springs or the suspension frame.

Solid axle suspension is typically used in vehicles that require high durability and load-bearing capacity. It is common in trucks, SUVs, off-road vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles.

    Off-Road Vehicles: The solid axle's ability to maintain wheel contact with rough terrain makes it ideal for off-roading. It is often found in vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler and Ford F-250, as it can withstand the extreme conditions of off-road driving.
    Heavy-Duty Trucks: Solid axles are used in pickup trucks, cargo trucks, and towing vehicles. They are capable of handling large amounts of weight, which makes them perfect for carrying heavy loads or towing trailers.
